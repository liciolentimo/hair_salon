# Beauty Hair Salon

This is a simple web app developed using Java and Spark as the framework. The owner/user can basically add a stylist and assign a client to the stylist. The stylist can have multiple clients but the client can only belong to one stylist. The owner can also update both the stylist and client's details as well as delete them.
